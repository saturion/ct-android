A port of Color Thief for Android

This is a port of https://github.com/lokesh/color-thief Java source to be compatible with Android API Levels 19 and later. Instead of the Java framework's objects, this variant utilizes the Android SDKs structures.

This port has been made with a device's camera input in mind, which means that specific color space identification algorithms from the original codebase were reduced to just one.
